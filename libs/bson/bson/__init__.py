BSON serialization and deserialization logic.
Specifications taken from: http://bsonspec.org/#/specification
The following types are unsupported, because for data exchange purposes, they're
over-engineered:
    0x06 (Undefined)
    0x0b (Regex - Exactly which flavor do you want? Better let higher level
        programmers make that decision.)
    0x0c (DBPointer)
    0x0d (JavaScript code)
    0x0e (Symbol)
    0x0f (JS w/ scope)
    0x11 (MongoDB-specific timestamp)

For binaries, only the default 0x0 type is supported.
