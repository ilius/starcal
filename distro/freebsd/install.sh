# "install" script does not work in FreeBSD 13.0
# the "case" bash command acts very strangely!
# that's why we use "install.py" script instead

# looks like we can install all dependencies with "pkg" command
# so we do not need to install pip3 then use "install-pip"
# but if you want to install or upgrade pip3:
# 	python3 -m ensurepip
# 	pip3 install -U pip
