## Changes since 3.1.2

- Fix many bugs/exceptions in MultiSpinButton (for date, time or number inputs)
- Fix local timezone detected to be "etc/localtime"
  - That might have been stored in events or shown in GUI
  - Possible bug in `dateutil.tz`, but we fixed it in our side
- Fix exception in Time Line: KeyError in scal3/timeline_box.py
- Always scan list of event/group files on startup to find the last eventId/groupId
  - Takes very little time (170,000 events take about a second to scan)
- Month Calendar: fix not being able to change border size in Customize dialog
- Fix bug in "First Run" (import configuration) dialog:
  - Caused restarting the program if the user clicked "Cancel"
- Fix minor bug in Preferences -> Plugins: underline in buttons
- Imrovement in Prefereces -> Plugins: About button non-sensible when no about text
- Fixes and improvements in openSUSE, Fedora and ArchLinux installers
  - install-suse: add missing dependencies:
    - typelib(Gtk) = 3.0
    - typelib(Gdk) = 3.0
    - typelib(GdkPixbuf) = 2.0
    - python3-gobject-Gdk
    - python3-gobject-cairo
  - install-suse: add "typelib(AppIndicator3)" as optional dependency
    - Because AppIndicator works much better in KDE Plasma
  - install-fedora: enable python3-igraph as optional dependency, it's been there since Fedora 27
  - install-archlinux: fix minumum python version
  - install-archlinux: add "python-igraph", "igraph" and "icu" as optional dependency
    - "igraph" and "icu" are needed by python-igraph, but their dependency is not handled by pacman
