# Changes from StarCalendar `2.4.2`

## Main Changes:

- Switch from Gtk 2 (with pygtk) to Gtk 3 (with pygi), so a better GUI
- Switch from Python 2.7 to Python 3.x
- Switch to JSON format for all config files and plugins
- Switch to BSON+JSON files for events, with (git-like) hash-based history tracking object
  - (dependency to python3-bson package)

Note: a Config Importer will import `~/.starcal2` directory into `~/.starcal3` at the first run

## Other Changes:

- Add "Monthly Event"
- Add Ubuntu-style SVG icons (ambiance and radiance) for AppIndicator, by Danial Behzadi
- Add event lock file, dependency to python3-psutil package
- More use of SVG for drawing (Drag & Drop icon, Event Manager group check box, etc)
- Drop 1.x compatibilty (config importer, customday importer)
- Fix "play azan" in pray times plugin (was not working if main window was not open)
- Some minor changes, bug fixes, optimizations, and cleaning
